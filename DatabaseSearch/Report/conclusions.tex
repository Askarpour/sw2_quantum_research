\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chp:conclusions}

In this work we explored several introductory aspects of quantum computing.

First of all Microsoft QDK, a quantum development environment that let us write programs for future quantum computers, and its language Q\#.

Then we got deep in the implementation of the entangled database for Grover Search, a specific part of the whole bigger algorithm that is often ignored and given for granted. In this context we provided not only a theory for performing passage needed to such entanglement, but also a working example of how this algorithm could be implemented with real gates.

Although the original purpose of this research project was to explore a new and unknown topic for the author, without any expectations, it turned out to be a little more. It was the opportunity to look with a critic eye to the state of the art and to propose approaches not yet explored, besides being of course a valuable experience.
