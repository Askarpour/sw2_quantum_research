Grover's Algorithm was originally devised to work with functions that are satisfied by a single input. Actually it has also been ``generalized to search in the presence of multiple \textit{winners}''. \cite{Boyer1998}

\bigskip

It turns out that Grover's Algorithm can be more useful in ``speeding up the solution to NP-complete problems such as 3-SAT'' than actual search. \cite{montanaro2016quantum}

\bigskip

We also considered spatial database search as a possible way of exploiting Grover's Algorithm, in the specific case of graphs with costs on arcs \cite{Aharonov:2001:QWG:380752.380758, childs2004spatial}.

Although there are some points of contact with Grover, none of them seemed to me of any use for our Max Flow Analysis problem.
