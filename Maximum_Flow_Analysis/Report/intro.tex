\section{Some notions on Quantum Computing}

Here we will mention the key concepts useful to understand the rest of the document. It cannot be considered neither a complete nor an exhaustive explanation on the basics of Quantum Computing.

We assume the reader will already know the basic concepts about linear algebra and elementary quantum gates. For more information on these basic topics, we recommend \cite{helwer2018quantum}.
