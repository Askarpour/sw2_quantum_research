# Quantum Researc Project
## Pierriccardo Olivieri 

This folder contains the project on quantum computing and is organized as follows:

*doc*: contains the final document about the project, written in Latex
*papers*: contains the reference papers used for this projects
*src*: contains the code in python

# Research Question:
In this research project i want to know more about quantum walks, the quantum version of the random walks,
analizing the coined quantum walk on a cycle graph. I want to know if thanks to this model of computation
is possible a speedup w.r.t. classical.
