# Quantum Researc Project
## Pierriccardo Olivieri 

This folder contains the project on quantum computing and is organized as follows:

- doc: contains the final document about the project, written in Latex
- papers: contains the reference papers used for this projects
- others: other useful material
- src: contains the code in python of the algotithms

# Research Question:
What is the quantum (random) walk, it's use and the diffrence with the classical random walk. 
An analysis of the coined quantum walk w.r.t. the classical.
