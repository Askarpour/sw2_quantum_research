    abstract = "This thesis focuses on applying analytical and numerical techniques to the problem of designing quantum circuits for quantum walks. We develop efficient quantum circuit implementations of continuous-time quantum walks using diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. Next, for the discrete-time Szegedy quantum walk model, we provide a theoretical framework for the development of efficient quantum circuits, and apply it to a wide variety of graphs. We also investigate the optimisation of numerical techniques to the general problem of implementing a unitary matrix. Lastly, we discuss design principles for the development of efficient quantum circuit implementations of quantum walks of different types.",

We then describe our results on the effects of decoherence on these quantum walks on a line, cycle and hypercube. We find high sensitivity to decoherence, increasing with the number of steps in the walk, as the particle is becoming more delocalised with each step. However, the effect of a small amount of decoherence can be to enhance the properties of the quantum walk that are desirable for the development of quantum algorithms, such as fast mixing times to uniform distributions.",

    abstract={Quantum walks are standard tools for searching graphs for marked vertices, and they often yield quadratic speedups over a classical random walk's hitting time. In some exceptional cases, however, the system only evolves by sign flips, staying in a uniform probability distribution for all time. We prove that the one-dimensional periodic lattice or cycle with any arrangement of marked vertices is such an exceptional configuration. Using this discovery, we construct a search problem where the quantum walk's random sampling yields an arbitrary speedup in query complexity over the classical random walk's hitting time. In this context, however, the mixing time to prepare the initial uniform state is a more suitable comparison than the hitting time, and then, the speedup is roughly quadratic.},
