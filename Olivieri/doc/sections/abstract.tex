\section{Abstract}

This project aims to analyze a computer science perspective of the random walk, in the fields of qunantum computing: the quantum walks. A random walk, known 
also as stochastic process, is a mathematical object that describes a path in which the steps are choosen randomly. In the fields of computer science this object can 
be seen as a building block useful to construct more complex algorithms. An interesting application, of random walks, concerns graphs, for instance graph search. 
Thanks to quanutm computers we can achive a speedup with respect to classical computer, even though this speedup differs among the graphs type.
