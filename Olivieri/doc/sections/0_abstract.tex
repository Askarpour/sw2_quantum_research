This project aims to analyze in a computer science perspective the quantum version of random walks: the quantum walks. This model of computation can be seen as a 
building block to construct new algorithms, here we are interested in a graph application in the domain of discrete time quantum walks. The question that this research 
want to answer is if a speedup w.r.t. classical is possible and discuss eventual limitations.
