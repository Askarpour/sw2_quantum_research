\section{Complexity and problem definition}

To talk about complexity in Quantum Walks we need to introduce the concept of Hitting Time. A definition can be found in \cite{6812670}
\\
\textbf{definition: Hitting Time}  



Now we can define the problem of searching for a marked vertex. Given the example proposed, using the Hadamard coin, of a 
cyclic graph with 8 nodes, to search for a marked vertex starting from given vertex we need to perform a walk in the graph 
and see if the current vertex is the one we are searching. The problem here is how often perform a measure, this choice
will impact also on the performances, indeed if we measure the circuit at each step we loose all the advantages of the quantum
coerenches and the performances will be equals to classical, we can gain some advantages by set the probability of measuring
very small \cite{Kempe_2003}.
