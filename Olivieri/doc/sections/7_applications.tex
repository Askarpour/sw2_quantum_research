\section{Applications}

The methods presented so far are meant to be general and could be applied in various context. For what I understand this is still a fresh research field 
but has a lot of potential for various applications that are difficult to solve randomized algorithm are used in context where an exact solution is too
hard to be found or too expansive computationally speaking here come these algorithms to help. For instance very famous classical problems, like 3-SAT, 
or TSP currently are solved in many case usiing randomized algorithm, obtaining a speed-up over the Hitting Time would be an important achievement \cite{Kempe_2003}. 
Another interesting application presented in \cite{Loke_2017} use the Szegedy Quantum Walk for the Page Rank algorithm: Quantum Page Rank algorithm. 
In \cite{Chen2019} an hybrid approach classical-quantum is used for a linear solver algorithm.
