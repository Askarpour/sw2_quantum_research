\section{Applications}

The methods presented so far are quite general methods that could be applied in various context. For what i understand this is still a fresh research field 
but has a lot of potential for various application that are difficult to solve. For instance some very famous classical problems, like 3-SAT, 
could be solved with a speedup w.r.t. classical. Another interesting application presented in \cite{Loke_2017} use the Szegedy Quantum Walk
for the Page Rank algorithm: Quantum Page Rank algorithm.
